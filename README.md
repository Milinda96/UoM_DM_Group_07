# Fuel Efficiency Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to analyze fuel efficiency trends, transmission preferences, vehicle classes, and manufacturer patterns in the Canadian light-duty vehicle market. The analysis is based on a dataset containing fuel consumption ratings and estimated carbon dioxide emissions for new vehicles from 2000 to 2022.

## Objectives

### 1. To identify the best fuel-efficient model
Apply pattern mining techniques to determine the best vehicle model with the lowest combined fuel consumption in L/100 km for the years 2020-2022.

### 2. To analyze the best transmission type
Utilize pattern mining techniques to identify the transmission type of the best fuel-efficient model, providing insights into the transmission preferences of eco-conscious consumers.

### 3. To identify the best fuel consumption vehicle classes and model
To identify the best fuel consumption (lowest value of "COMB (L/100 km)") for each vehicle class and model using pattern mining techniques

### 4. To explore manufacturer trends
Apply clustering to identify patterns in manufacturers' fuel efficiency and determine whether specific manufacturers consistently produce fuel-efficient models or if there are shifts in manufacturers' fuel efficiency over time.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information on fuel consumption ratings and estimated carbon dioxide emissions for new light-duty vehicles available for purchase in Canada. To facilitate comparisons across different model years, the fuel consumption ratings for vehicles from 2000 to 2022 have been adjusted to better reflect real-world driving conditions. It's important to note that these values are approximations derived from the original ratings and are not based on actual vehicle testing.
